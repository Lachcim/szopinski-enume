	\section{Abstract}
	
	This project explores the numerical methods of solving systems of linear
	equations and finding eigenvalues of matrices. The following concepts are
	discussed within this document:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computing the machine epsilon of an environment
		\item Solving linear equation systems using Gaussian elimination with
		partial pivoting
		\item Solving linear equation systems using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel
		algorithms
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Task 1: Computing the machine epsilon}
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	The goal of this task was to find the machine epsilon of the MATLAB
	environment, i.e. the maximum relative error of a floating-point
	representation of a number.
	
	\subsection{Implementation}
	
	The computation of the machine epsilon is based on the following two
	observations:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In binary computer environments, the epsilon is a negative power
		of two.
		\item The machine epsilon can also be expressed as:
		\begin{equation}
			eps = \min\{x \in M: fl(1 + x) > 1 \land x > 0\}
		\end{equation}
		i.e. the smallest representable number such that, when added to $1$,
		has a floating point representation greater than $1$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	An arbitrary starting point, in this case $2^0$, can thus be chosen, and its
	value can then be sequentially halved until the criterion $fl(1 + x) > 1$ is
	no longer met.
	
	\subsection{Program output}
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		Found epsilon is 2.2204e-16
		Epsilon is 2.2204e-16
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\subsection{Observations}
	
	An epsilon of $2.2204 \cdot 10^{-16} = 2^{-52}$ is indicative of a standard
	double-precision IEEE 754 floating point binary representation.
